## PART B: WIKIPEDIA DRAFT (Hold Until Independent Sources Exist)

### Why Hold?

Wikipedia requires:
- **Notability**: Significant coverage in reliable, independent sources (news, press, publications)
- **No autobiographies**: Articles about yourself are strongly discouraged (WP:AUTOBIO)
- **Verifiability**: Every claim needs a citation from a published source you didn't write

### What You Need Before Publishing

At minimum 2-3 of these:
- [ ] Local news article about Project Lavos (Courier Journal, Louisville Business First, LEO Weekly)
- [ ] Tech blog feature or interview (dev.to featured post, Hacker News discussion, indie hacker profile)
- [ ] Business directory profile with editorial content (Louisville Chamber of Commerce spotlight)
- [ ] Podcast appearance or conference talk (recorded, published online)
- [ ] Client testimonial published on a third-party site (Google Reviews, Clutch, DesignRush)

### Draft Article (Ready When Sources Exist)

Below is a Wikipedia-style article draft. Replace `[citation needed]` with actual sources when available. Written in neutral, encyclopedic tone per Wikipedia's Manual of Style.

**Matthew Scott** (also known online as **guitargnarr**) is an American web developer, AI consultant, and founder of **Project Lavos**, a web development and AI consulting studio based in Louisville, Kentucky.[citation needed]

#### Career

Scott founded Project Lavos, a web development and artificial intelligence consulting studio operating out of Louisville, Kentucky.[citation needed] The studio specializes in building websites for small and medium-sized businesses, with a focus on industries including healthcare, legal services, food and beverage, retail, and personal services.[citation needed]

As of 2026, Project Lavos has produced over 67 deployed demonstration websites for Louisville-area businesses, all built as spec work using publicly available business information to demonstrate capability.[citation needed] The sites are deployed on Vercel and serve as a working portfolio rather than static mockups.[citation needed]

Scott's development methodology centers on what he describes as "substance over flash," emphasizing deployed, functional software over presentations or proposals.[citation needed] His technical stack includes React, TypeScript, Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, with deployment on Vercel and Render platforms.[citation needed]

#### AI Consulting

In addition to web development, Scott works as an AI consultant, building and maintaining over 50 domain-specific AI models using Ollama for applications spanning career coaching, code review, guitar education, and business analysis.[citation needed] He has developed several AI-powered web applications including PhishGuard, an anti-phishing email detection tool using natural language processing, and Vantage, a local job market analysis platform.[citation needed]

Scott has written about AI collaboration methodology, including "The Verification Gap" (2026), which examines challenges in verifying AI-generated code and the distinction between reading source code and observing actual software behavior.[citation needed]

#### Guitar Education

Scott created FretVision, an interactive guitar fretboard learning application, and published a series of 24 guitar scale reference books containing a total of 11,520 exercises across 24 scale types, 12 keys, and 5 CAGED positions.[citation needed] The tablature is computationally generated using deterministic fretboard logic rather than hand-transcribed.[citation needed]

#### Philosophy and Approach

Scott's professional manifesto, "What One Person Can Build," argues that modern AI collaboration tools enable individual developers to produce work at a scale previously requiring teams, citing his own output of 67 websites, 51 AI models, and 96 live URLs as evidence.[citation needed] His four core principles are: "Substance First" (working software over pitches), "Built to Last" (durable systems), "Measure Twice" (testing before shipping), and "People Over Tech" (technology serves humans).[citation needed]

## PART C: ACTIONS TO BUILD TOWARD WIKIPEDIA NOTABILITY

These create the independent sources needed for a viable Wikipedia article:

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Create Wikidata entry** (Part A above)
2. **Write a dev.to article** about building 67 websites as one person with AI -- this becomes a citable source
3. **Submit to Louisville Business First** for a "people on the move" or startup spotlight mention

### Short-Term (Next 2-4 Weeks)
4. **Pitch Courier Journal** tech section about AI + small business web development in Louisville
5. **Create Crunchbase profile** for Project Lavos (free tier)
6. **Record a short podcast or video** explaining your approach -- publish on YouTube

### Medium-Term (1-3 Months)
7. **Speak at a Louisville tech meetup** (LouieDev, Code Louisville) -- documented talks count as sources
8. **Get listed on Clutch.co or DesignRush** -- these are considered reliable sources by Wikipedia
9. **Client testimonials on Google Business Profile** (feeds Knowledge Panel AND provides social proof)

### When You Have 3+ Independent Sources
10. Ask a Wikipedia editor (not yourself) to create the article using the draft above
11. Or submit through Wikipedia's "Articles for Creation" (AfC) process as a draft
