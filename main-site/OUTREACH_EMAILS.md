**DEMO:** https://gray-family-dentistry.vercel.app

Dr. Gray,

I'm Matthew, a web developer here in Louisville. I build websites for local businesses, and I put one together for your practice.

Here it is: https://gray-family-dentistry.vercel.app

It's live right now -- worth a look on your phone. I tried to capture the caliber of what you do. Your background at USC and the cosmetic work you offer is a real differentiator in Louisville, and I wanted that to come through.

The site loads fast, works on every device, and there's zero maintenance on your end. No WordPress, no plugins, nothing to update or worry about. I take care of all of that.

I'm a one-person shop. No agency overhead, no long-term contracts. I just like building things for businesses I respect and seeing if it's a fit.

If you like what you see, happy to talk. If not, genuinely no worries.

Holly,

I'm Matthew, a web developer in Louisville. I've been building websites for local businesses, and I put one together for your practice.

Take a look: https://ky-family-lawyer.vercel.app

Thirty years in family law is something. I tried to make the site feel the way your practice probably feels to your clients -- calm, trustworthy, and professional. The kind of thing that gives someone confidence when they're going through a hard time and looking for help.

It works well on phones, loads quickly, and I handle all the technical side. Nothing for you to maintain.

No contracts, no pressure. Just wanted to show you what I had in mind rather than describe it.

I've been a fan of what you've built on Terra Crossing. Korean-American fusion done well, real following since 2017. I wanted to make something that lets people find your menu, your hours, and your story without going through a delivery app.

Your own site means customers can come straight to you. No middleman taking a cut.

I handle all the technical stuff -- hosting, security, updates. No contracts, month-to-month, and a lot less than what agencies charge.

Take a look and see what you think. No strings attached.

Nothing complicated -- just your menu, your hours, your location, and a feel for the place. The kind of thing a neighbor could send to a friend who just moved to Middletown.

Thirty years of serving the community is something special. I just wanted to give it a small home online.
