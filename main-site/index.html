          <h2>Development Methodology</h2>
          <p>Four core principles guide all work:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Substance first - Working software over impressive pitches.</li>
            <li>Built to last - Good systems outlast good intentions.</li>
            <li>Measure twice - Test the work, then ship it.</li>
            <li>People over tech - Technology works for humans, not the reverse.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Additional principles: "Show, don't tell" (working software over impressive pitches), "Simple scales" (complexity is easy, clarity takes work), "Test the seams" (systems fail where they connect), "Tools serve people" (technology works for humans, not the reverse).</p>

Articles are available at projectlavos.com/blog under the heading "Beyond the Code". Featured article: "The Verification Gap" (February 2026) - an exploration of verification challenges in AI-assisted development, examining the gap between what AI generates and what humans can verify.</p>
