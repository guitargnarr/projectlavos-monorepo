# What One Person Can Build

This is not a portfolio. It's proof.

---

## The Evidence

**51 websites** built for Louisville businesses. Not mockups. Live, deployed, working.

**51 AI models** trained for specific domains. Career coaching, market analysis, code generation, guitar theory.

**96 live URLs** across Vercel, Render, Railway. All verified. All HTTP 200.

**One person.**

## What This Proves

A solo developer with AI collaboration can operate at agency scale.

Not in theory. In production.

The systems are documented. The workflows are repeatable. The results are verifiable.

---

## The Method

**Parallel Development** - 4 features simultaneously, 100% success rate.

**Ground Truth Verification** - Every claim tested. Screenshots. HTTP checks. No interpretation without evidence.

**Fix First** - Don't ask. Fix. Show the fix working.

**Trust the Filter** - The right people recognize real work. Everyone else is noise.

## What I'm Not Selling

- Promises
- Credentials
- Potential

## What I Am Showing

- 51 sites you can visit
- Systems you can read
- Proof you can verify

## The Question

Not "can he do this?"

The portfolio answers that.

The question is: "Do you need what's already built?"

## Contact

If you recognize the work, reach out.

If you need convincing, I'm not for you.
